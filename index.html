          <p class="about">Iâ€™m a dedicated and dynamic web developer with a strong growth mindset. I
             spent the past few years working in a rubber stamp factory cheerfully assisting whichever department
             needed help most each day. When the owner asked me to help him troubleshoot a new website for the
             company I started to look more critically at websites and began to research how to make our own better.
              I knew I had found my passion the moment that I wrote my first Javascript script that interacted with
               the webpage. I had made something from nothing, and had found the process of troubleshooting that it
                took to get there extremely rewarding.</p>
                <p class="about">Outside of programming I adore folk dancing, board games, dogs, and infusing alcohol.</p>

            <div class="description">I am a huge fan of board games, and the premier website for board games (<a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com">Board Game Geek</a>) has a counter-intuitive system for logging plays. With that in mind, I made an app that makes it easy to log
              plays using Ruby on Rails, Javascript, jQuery, HTML/CSS, Handlebars, and Bootstrap.</div>

            <div class="description">When I met up to make an app with fellow developers Wei Liu and Cathy Obrien we discovered that there was nothing closer to our hearts than tasty food, so we set forward to make an app that lets you track restuarants.  The app lets the user search for and log restuarants into a wish list using the Google Maps Javascript API, Express.js, MongoDB, Javascript, HTML/CSS, Handlebars, and Bootstrap.</div>

            <div class="description underline"><a href="https://dsweetser.github.io/tic-tac-toe/">Tic-Tac-Plaid: the marriage of two grids.</a></div>
            <div class="description">I have fond memories of learning Tic-Tac-Toe as a child and being excited about the game until I realizing, several years later, how quickly it became stale.  However, I had a second bout of enthusiasm for the subject when I set out to build a Tic-Tac-Toe web app. Being a huge fan of plaid, my mind immediately drew a connection between the two grids and the theme made the whole thing significantly
              more fun. The moment that I registred a click on the page to make an X on the screen was so rewarding, I knew then I had found my calling. This project was made using Javascript, HTML/CSS, jQuery, and Bootstrap.</div>
